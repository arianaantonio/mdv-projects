<p>Surprise surprise! I stuck with my hiking story. While it would have been nice to work with a new story this time, I felt that this weeks assignment was so difficult and complicated that I needed the help of being able to reuse some code. Lame reason, I know, but it was neccessary for my sanity.</p>
